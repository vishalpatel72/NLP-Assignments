"As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that	1.3897213269128188
is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States-	1.3499754960950319
schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested	0.050764982755153835

is being done in this field".   Displaying his knowledge of	1.433479085026334
music, the New England-born President remarked that "probably the	0.7798004021886119
best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans-	0.3573584218292792
and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary	0.3174022364248723
musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated all across	0.29104642267888015
the United States.   "This is a great national cultural asset,	1.858055488260151
and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing	0.3656647572622686
as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today at the	1.6318970157461574

The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p& m&, remaining	0.11142518460489319
for about 45 minutes.   The Brevard visitors had very little	2.4226745263815936
to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided	0.3740904540490343
that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look "sad"**h	0.759785864651364
they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's	0.06949492927762253

He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery "is	1.2991015770639682

one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.   In 45 minutes,	5.399641389248078
the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art	0.09875711622135529
from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century.   A few of them	1.2686812735387207
said they "preferred contemporary art".   Among the other	0.05206653448937193
artists, whose paintings were discussed were Boucher, Courbet, Fra	0.04643733177665538

the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.   They came together in	0.07656253348867238

THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly reached	2.3363027775185636
the breaking point after eight years.   John had a job in a small	0.1303001772787281
firm where the work was dull and monotonous. He would come home in	0.4696191190959092
the evening tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play with	0.102676324302358
their three children, or spend much time chatting with his wife.	0.33335544552195623

Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary complained often	0.4796264943957566
that he didn't help around the house, and that he didn't really	1.9515773471109308
care about the family. She accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told	1.7153675789247413
her she demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted	0.34489657581225464
and miserable.   Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite	0.10741549790835324
plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could be done. The	0.47672439237570485

to the people of this community case work service and counseling on	1.1303526839396951
a wide variety of family problems.   Because neither of them really	1.0100514084667962

to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia,	0.3104427837905092
the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have been receiving	0.10535535321877537

The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of	0.13100274218866295
the problems confronting the other. They are now working together toward	0.27323891791079447
solving their difficulties.   JOHN received a promotion	0.24888243517825698
in his firm. He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on	0.4040403488542507
life. Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings,	0.23330450762629037
and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session	3.061543771112584

One of the initial questions put to President	3.53025642663342
Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his	0.4032014041848064
attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev. Mr& Kennedy	2.4988075074075913
replied:   @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional	0.08449305195375643
exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground".   The	0.36514615061570266
President knew that a confrontation with Mr& Khrushchev sooner or	0.27778074452635315
later probably was inevitable and even desirable. But he was convinced	0.5103204469067694
that the realities of power- military, economic and ideological-	1.3785463096784412
were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that	0.49668650647876905
these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting. He	0.4222373151129126
wanted to buy time to strengthen the U& S& and its allies and	1.5805812510484951
to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.   Last Friday	2.027586063070598
the White House announced:   President Kennedy will	3.7104037269360917
meet	1.0
with Soviet Premier Nikita S& Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and	0.5867991277561578
4.   The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration	0.36872735908862225
in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in fact, had been	0.05023508169029882
a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency	1.180948040645915
of a meeting with the Soviet leader. He was not going to Vienna	0.38939763798200056
to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow	0.0868384428145379
last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned. But	0.05820961364375392
Mr& Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with	2.0066719491379312
Mr& Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.	0.3216997051280704

That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting.	0.08573223872724824

Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy	0.4994361153477422
with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the	0.4107602229837239
