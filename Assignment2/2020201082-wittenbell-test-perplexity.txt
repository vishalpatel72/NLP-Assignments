The Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing	2.4274081442729973
the	1.0
Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave danger that	2.3896056305135884
has existed.   The danger lay not in believing that our own ~A-bombs	3.8395639770453056
would deter Russia's use of hers; that theory was and is	3.288101906941172
sound. The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence	3.3739040327471694
was enough.   By limiting American strength too much to nuclear	2.9816434359136053
strength, this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war	3.2582676708164997
besides a nuclear war. This strategy heightened the possibility that	2.7701929349361016
we would have a nuclear war.   It also weakened our diplomatic	4.133289882097778
stance, because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear	3.7187972227435067
war except in the ultimate extremity.   This left the Soviets	3.3755184035731527
plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable	1.920535635151222
impunity.   By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing	2.853671585190905

Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost	2.49964731600531
from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase	4.531964277262363
for the Milledgeville State Hospital.   Actually it amounts	2.1517150396165743
to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving, considering	3.63094304880501
the additional half-million dollars Gov& Vandiver allocated	1.4708707339495186

a sizable hunk of money and is. But exactly how far it will go toward	5.246146534468416
improving conditions is another question because there is so much that	5.089600024324697
needs doing.   The practice of charging employes for meals whether	2.7474942042899775
they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished. The work week	3.9725195319093425
of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be	3.9567031633478646
reduced.   More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.	2.137993133895872
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.   Even with	3.4832028947908955
the increase in funds for the next fiscal year, Georgia will be spending	4.376445856545026
only around $3.15 per day per patient. The national average is	4.656941169255862
more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental	6.1683874458053145
health field to be too low. Kansas, regarded as tops in the nation in	4.337471569892621

#THE END OF TRUJILLO#	3.5855469150451893
	1.0
Assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive	2.644839902308195
to men of good conscience. Rafael Trujillo, the often-blood thirsty	2.0909150781797687
dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years, perhaps deserved	4.101972239824941
his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history. But whether the murder	3.6239142201048624
of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people	2.3561945725888784
of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.	3.7302757440526912
	1.0
Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination. The responsibility	3.2900284325429543
for scores of deaths, including the abduction and murder of Jesus	2.901178673129306
Maria Galindez, a professor at Columbia University in New York,	3.0731664164411936
has been laid at his door. He had been involved in countless schemes	4.813588761776801
to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such	2.976205361233178
as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela. It was a sort of poetic	2.780035799474094
justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow	4.539701798825808
the Venezuelan government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican	2.594740964026809
arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, has	1.1637691433250859
been uncovered and quashed.   The recent history of the Dominican	3.0607777894668544
Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly	4.4991792356846405
benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive. Unquestionably	2.249327277557818
Trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved	3.8838652624392878
public facilities such as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and	2.7428426384725046
investment and raised the standard of living notably. But the price	3.6023444886684226
was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.	3.4275523146226408
El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth. The jails were	2.669635021395201
filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his	2.302977522093246
displeasure. He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States	1.9034989099726494
and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his	2.1061060648153482
influence extended even to Congress.   Until the last year or so	3.8957129823324093
the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article	4.4009160323309775
of faith with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession	2.2004351943698963
was accepted here as evidence of his good character. Tardily the Government	3.3983762305508614
here	1.0
came to understand how this country's own reputation was	2.8476483295367414
tarnished by the association with repression. Last year, after Trujillo	3.6757870718670365
had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean, the	2.379266761722603
United States and many other members of the Organization of American	4.5678764927919895
States broke diplomatic relations with him.   Thereupon followed	2.5027196563382215
a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines. Trujillo's	2.194336362752993
dictatorship had been along conservative, right-wing lines. But	1.9859410513188074
after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist	2.5034762492300615
slogans. There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with	3.0237632119598583
Castro in Cuba, previously a <bete noire> to Trujillo- thus	1.762937364654045
illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.	4.606646917184645
	1.0
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle. The	2.4851367152586934
Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little	3.010532074171892
freedom for a generation, and all alternative leadership has been	3.297765186619953
suppressed. Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability, but	3.6734491899046375
the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger. The Dominican	3.308652612281538
Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily	1.7295533374591585
as toward Western freedom. Such a twist would be a tragedy for	3.242836893417599
the Dominican people, who deserve to breathe without fear. For that	2.9676197416394356
reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative	2.926225378131384
government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy	3.750286465713735

occupation. It was not a part of any one of the three (later four)	6.022417929294209
zones for occupation by Soviet, American, British, and French troops	2.3926591531244474

offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin	3.3128324314130055
and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany.	4.423098733622716
	1.0
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border	3.7851840096940994

Britain,	1.0
France, and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's	4.193299141335794
gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other	2.910059322547121
West German officials to West Berlin. The Chancellor had as	3.075622319978294
much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin- and was certainly	4.062721755702688
less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard	2.2126933529656387
Eisler.   The British and other replies to that Moscow note	3.4726371527455533
pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities "to integrate East	3.4188679014066943
Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting	3.8638726629613123
to make it the capital of East Germany". They insisted on	4.698521251708638
the "fundamental fact" that "the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite	4.305475655186872
status".   This is far from acknowledging or recognizing	2.8138938244270255
those efforts as an accomplished fact. There remains, of course, the	4.041233386383993
question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent	4.07423200465424
the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.   One ground	2.336865689417921
of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over	2.176197670512098
into West Berlin as Communist "vopos" try to gun down fleeing	2.6621023237001977
unarmed residents. Another remained when an American Army car was	2.569639605708207

Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional	3.3275226084164773
action requiring the Federal Communications Commission	2.372128904370826
to ban such advertising through its licensing power.   The National	2.505398684975051
Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor	1.4086504378606557
commercials. Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this	2.703899674434773
policy. Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific	3.3334762957836355
prohibition.   Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and	2.494654870781737
some state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek congressional	2.9729740273611136
action? Simply because the subverting action of firms that are	3.2070582919231283
not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and ~TV	3.3704760635045
stations that are not members of the ~NAB tends to spread.	3.406997354884935

Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want	2.826076403423346
to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly	2.9767551840799555
from the efforts of non-code competitors.   Although the	2.0958656733621432
false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly	2.1182294496543377
no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which ~TV	2.5168874811251727
soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference	2.769547018159044
between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him	1.7634199001543938
into downing bourbon.   A law is needed.	2.422557118778635

Registered Democrats in New York City this year have	3.4249395240100875
the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and	2.7471398537294864
other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.	4.314799884859729
	1.0
In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may have found	3.765336851813587
some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.	4.154898728009529
	1.0
Mayor Robert F& Wagner must, as his opponents demand, assume	2.95065834993652
responsibility for his performance in office. While all citizens	4.083179357434023
share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious	2.479311002078946
problems in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies. The	3.6915526262405756
Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.	3.159984784971732
	1.0
State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand, cannot effectively	2.516147176826517
deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders	4.761245924911051
who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than	4.160052598498539
in the city's welfare. They, too, have links with the city's	3.0920481731969724
ills.   Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited. Mayor	3.3103391351733595
Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed	2.3096746949664624
than those of Mr& Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence	3.615840629867476
in his more protected state post.   As Mayor, Mr& Levitt	2.2445417610593243
might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters	4.3078031820357445
would like. His election, on the other hand, would unquestionably	3.5609800680793
strengthen the "regulars".   Mr& Wagner might or might	1.7840776389040645
not be a "new" Mayor in this third term, now that he is free of	5.32034173375155
the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls "bosses". These	3.52673612331058
are, of course, the same people whose support he has only now rejected	4.523948203989145
to seek the independent vote.   But his reelection would strengthen	2.8493398873101703
the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him.	2.989247916405581

If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish,	3.225956820423773

#LITTLE WAR, BIG TEST#	1.2548854604005069
	1.0
Both Mr& ~K's have so far continued	2.475617842643769
to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos.   President	2.347968763578232
Kennedy, already two quiet demands down, still refused Thursday to	2.332727221592165
be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow. But at the same	3.026472948201447
time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the	3.4433669398654567
fighting. And Secretary Rusk, en route to Bangkok, doubtless is	2.11566548643562
trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian	3.655094331583686
or Thai ~SEATO forces.   For Mr& Kennedy, speaking	2.24146661999824
softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad	4.111421563906402
situation. The new President is in no position to start out his dealings	5.088471689898431
with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs. He must show at the outset	2.815274015218779
that he means exactly what he says.   In this case he has put	5.82039997813615
the alternatives clearly to Mr& Khrushchev for the third time. At	4.238302802743042
his press conference Mr& Kennedy said, "All we want in Laos	4.099153074947433
is peace not war **h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn".	3.5783483153528977
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in	4.2143832608652865
unprovocative but ready position.   Since Laos is of no more purely	3.8543681256147546
military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this	4.354233594074757
approach might be expected to head off Mr& Khrushchev for the moment.	4.411033918734183
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in	3.917217223014116
Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course	3.7766091841812646
that would appear to cost him little on the spot, but would bog Washington	4.324856259511289
in a tactical mess.   As wars go, Laos is an extremely	2.585991885964122
little one. Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day. The	3.898682516383238
hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000	2.7843660601580957
tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters. But for the United States and	2.6264198898263653
its ~SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested	3.1991159463975105
government army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp	1.4876186036169088
terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.	2.538140764641813
But if anything can bring home to Mr& Khrushchev the idea that he	4.5184897077366255
will not really get much enjoyment from watching this	2.627578825180933
Braddock-against-the-Indians	1.0
contest, it will probably be the fact that ~SEATO	4.2263948579026005
forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that Moscow has something	4.328948168154715
to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations	2.547940117228154
with Washington.   Fortunately both the Republicans and America's	2.600849974828146
chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos	2.7300654871226513
aim of the President. Actually it would be more accurate to say that	4.123043215104695
the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British	3.204201430130321
policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining	3.281798654046362
table.   It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle	3.750145560357972
so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.	4.504837099053548
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after	2.4518177731612907
the Geneva conference of 1954, and last year Washington backed the	4.2122015805607615
rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.   But	1.6566570149066826
since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist	3.6784525481084818
position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire	4.7570630346769995
patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of	3.1411005028088526
interested powers.   The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof	3.3875514956567243
Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.	3.5990846179752936
But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and for the sake of the	4.166964542921845
Laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority	3.43089968368363
now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that	3.9683475542183757
country from the cold war had to be made. The world awaits Mr& Khrushchev's	5.039170798575322

The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally controlled	2.5282087724581994

report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.	4.270596343385982

This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the	3.007748348699123
District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private,	6.425773896768158
state, or municipal ~ETV efforts. The funds would be used	2.631660245378264
for equipment, not for land, buildings, or operation.   The relatively	2.945585934700706
few communities that have educational stations have found them	3.3420178232529842
of considerable value. But, lacking money from commercial sponsors, the	2.6335102274233897

#A GOOD MAN DEPARTS GOODBY, MR& SAM#	1.8394593586835357
	1.0
Sam Rayburn was a good man,	3.0483475802690134
a good American, and, third, a good Democrat.   He was all	3.2586389275356473
of these rolled into one sturdy figure; Mr& Speaker, Mr& Sam,	2.616339608607874
and Mr& Democrat, at one and the same time.   The House was	3.88799134806221
his habitat and there he flourished, first as a young representative,	4.498484295267097
then as a forceful committee chairman, and finally in the post for which	3.659342019412046
he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House, and second	2.9292434850761224
most powerful man in Washington.   Mr& Rayburn was not an easy	3.8938119467602603
man to classify or to label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New	3.485437834654865
Deal, the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was	4.0335008005997794
not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that persuasion will	1.9230142324440278
miss him as much as any.   Two of the vital qualities demanded	4.05314272785694
of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence	3.846941364701355
and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with	3.2039089160217915
him to the grave, for he was never loquacious, and his word, once	4.532597511341357
given, was not subject to retraction. It might be added that as he kept	4.8573130317565845
his word so he expected that others keep theirs.   The demonstration	3.4699597524915378
of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical. His leadership	2.474481811767941
was not for audiences. A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it	3.132903899180175
was not, one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.	4.044112507724451
He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon his chest, his	4.8854237767601685
hands gripping the side of a desk, and the political and legislative	4.981144071942248
chatter would subside into silence.   He spoke briefly, sensibly,	2.4728733330104626
to the point and without oratorical flourishes He made good, plain	3.915586266761797
American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted	4.2719474706979135
upon it.   These public efforts were rare because Mr& Rayburn	2.6990743353654114
normally did his counseling, persuading and educating long before	2.0561287754862834
an issue reached its test on the House floor. He expected Democrats	3.620988108165852
to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them. With	4.97689737826281
his long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing in a political	4.5697842260479655
leader.   {He was, of course, in the House for a very long	6.32449051565381
time. There are only two men remaining in Congress who, with Rayburn,	4.35996170389001
voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917. To	4.114719276845091
almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the	5.015430086053041
existence of Mr& Sam coincided with that of the House}.	3.3100342097477413
And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer of it was the	5.820581559540074
end of his desire and ambition. The Senate to him was not the "upper	5.815654285155969
body" and he corrected those who said he served "under" the	3.9168097405320252
president. He served "with" him.   Sound the roll of those	3.7470415726654096
with whom he served and who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson,	4.002900470478787
with whom he began his years in Washington, Warren G& Harding,	4.37195140978335
Calvin Coolidge, ~FDR, with whom he managed a social revolution.	3.4397872324949734
And those still with us, Herbert C& Hoover, Harry S& Truman,	2.2555858625619836
Dwight D& Eisenhower and John F& Kennedy.   He was	2.993174765840525
a fighter for those of his own party. Mr& Truman has only to recall	4.306505862106422
the "hopeless" campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan	4.610151673713719
he was and the first experience of Mr& Kennedy with Congress would	4.5246768415176275
have been sadder than it was had not Mr& Sam been there. As it	4.298763236938512
was, his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.	4.463709129446771
	1.0
With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was	2.3017599928631616
his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept his attacks	3.235715272722881
on Republicanism for partisan campaigns, but that is part of the game	3.681045499396253
he	1.0
was born to play.   Under any name- Mr& Speaker, Mr&	3.0891070027725234
Democrat, Mr& Sam- he was a good man. #~UN OFF THE CONGO TRACK#	4.10995456878198

Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the	3.6883997096104277
cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent	3.738998873279306
death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.	2.4018577660365756
	1.0
In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported from that	2.8690109170506246
jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers dismembered the	2.0179602930565834
bodies and tossed the remains into the river. The excuse was offered	4.226479884082215
for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.	3.9160642000782997
In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central	3.584553732576252
government might be condoned, had the victims been serving the cause	3.1270625197382693
of dissident Katanga.   Does this suggest that the Congo	3.0196357582168147
is fit for nationhood or that ~UN is making any progress whatever	2.998700719558769
toward its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through the past	4.9199226878014555
six	1.0
weeks violence has been piled upon violence. Mass rapes, troop mutinies,	2.0741997068553606
uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures,	1.8812095894254512
given no sanction by any political authority, have become almost	2.480997245466184
daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is	2.533854096932992
not the work of Katanga. It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville	4.708750156974459
government, which is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable	2.6208857289840872
of governing, and commanding only such limited credit abroad as ~UN	2.40810041234766
support gives it.   The main question raised by the incident is	4.207432815526281
how much longer will ~UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo	3.6205639108253798
problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in	4.843914642778052
present terms? The probable answer is that it will do so just as long	6.010786762988637
as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African	3.1021313430802198
nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting	4.7796704568005985
ruin on Central Africa.   Right now, they are pushing	2.9718979241879797
a resolution which would have ~UN use its forces to invade and subjugate	3.8362153071222376
Katanga. That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several	1.924504548964842
points of view. The ~UN army is too weak, too demoralized for	3.2976914283755057
the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it	3.4699280566869777
is now garrisoned. Last, it makes no sense to deliver Katanga, the one	3.6419199497910753
reasonably solid territory, into the existing chaos.   The Congo	2.6104107610655487
should have been mandated, because it was not ready for independence.	4.334623211469142
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed	3.1072500315487965
over wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because	5.0307414424919425
it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism. But if	3.28810395696233
any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly, it	4.104371063727976
is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and	5.186680853106921
urge some new approach. Otherwise, ~UN will march blindly on to	2.508757951651747
certain defeat.	1.0

A recent editorial discussing	1.2260029908212524
a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific	2.456185592167544
Co& and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized	3.19968195641628
on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.	4.226787169646827
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that	3.539339747625816
the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed	2.5886693441300235
40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction	4.540411581556231
in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our comment	4.760810712378153
was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate form and that	3.4298645920099156
sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such	4.514973850753829
an agreement. The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad	4.298234735165811
had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but	2.1412056961374533
that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.	5.302198827631139
	1.0
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad	2.9171367090104465
gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.	4.41855848044924
Also, normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision	2.9602573157913867
more or less academic.   The situation with regard to the Southern	3.2801347467183284
Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable	3.713759813234223
to other situations in other industries. The solution reached in	3.27673729664668
the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally	3.8166640780290333

Time was when the house of delegates	4.639429711854198
of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense	3.28841302156704
side. But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of	3.394513240360636
the bar, and when the lads met in St& Louis, it was not to grumble	5.683305378484784
about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations	4.214698259935611
was scarcely less than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and	2.221133196063033
there.   It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope	3.2054631166872234
for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's wonderful, and	2.5611995491753046
"world law", it's wonderful, too, and shouldn't we get an international	3.057930202590279
covenant extending it into space, before the Russians put	3.5447229143633256
some claim jumper on the moon?   Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev	2.807255250895353
was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build	3.8588688433653617
a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of ~TNT, to knock	3.97476468111207
sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice	3.4806027984040933
of surrendering West Berlin to communism.   A nuclear pacifier	2.7512084918766604
of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger	2.9988625388259535
than anything the United States has triggered experimentally- would	2.9003102733329644
certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might	2.795304263750448
use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St&	4.37459375756311
Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.	4.514584223639807

While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed	5.939068812496817
an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in	3.559434628607849
the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.   "Fools",	2.034271636378419
he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?   The	4.499932941781921
only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't	4.551351061300452
playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but	3.594722677120277
perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this	3.6579427868616423
feeble effort.   Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason	3.003656474752725
was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American	3.376404289121083
plane by a demented Algerian with a gun. The craft made the familiar	3.5177254281130996
unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro	3.1640273567240276
rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian	3.533074281923047
foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock	3.914378016955838
Shadow. The plane was sent back to the United States, for	4.585701967968492
a change, but Castro kept the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable	3.41836688205391
recruit to the revolution.   Less respect for the legal	3.6417249371138394
conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara,	2.0774093769519055
who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting	2.692449012631023
in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined	2.0304527143247686
from the United States embassy at Caracas, Venezuela. The contents	2.3216131876373476
were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen, who were on hand	3.2901463954891077
to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.	3.080467820889062

Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing	2.9766459621498
American diplomatic papers and planes, but the Kennedy administration	2.65672008086811
can always file a demurrer to the effect that, but for its own	4.258742497456507
incompetence in protecting American interests, these things would	2.054202439584262
not happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion	3.367323296478131
mounted by the administration last April, which, we trust, is not	3.8829192735684424
symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious	4.460570297143333
Khrushchev.   Pass the iron rations, please, and light another	2.7123984999268917
candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read	3.2656895567633324

a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which	3.958619944177144

#A SHOCK WAVE FROM AFRICA#	1.6876221515811727
	1.0
WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death	1.3291404230464194
in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.	2.6451819592998977
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace, and	5.7686305571316625
his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously. It was	3.3817994344224065
on the eve of a momentous U&N& session to come to grips with cold	3.621099075893225
war issues. His firm hand will be desperately missed.   Mr&	2.6162069092297355
Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace. He had sought	4.998680508507691
talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga	1.9548905760520696
province where recent fighting had been bloody. He earnestly	2.3963732399089035
urged a cease-fire.   The story of the fatal crash is not fully	3.4408113463384495
known. The U&N&-chartered plane which was flying from the conference	2.6588840134112153
city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun	2.2342961919229314
bullets last weekend and was newly repaired. Whether this, or	2.6068968614393233
overt action, was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.	3.8529531263156187
	1.0
The death of Mr& Hammarskjold removes the United Nations'	3.683125901300019
most controversial leader. He was controversial because he was uncompromising	3.7222855595535282
for peace and freedom with justice. He courageously defended	3.2634677754117054
the rights of small nations, and he stood his ground against the	3.813840032317204
savage attacks of the Communist bloc.   The Congo, in whose cause	3.4060655831950633
he died, was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies	4.290944236751299
had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war	2.9361361243399147
and workable solutions were beginning to take shape. When the recent	4.079587591751815
Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr& Hammarskjold, despite	1.682505344748223
the danger, flew to exert a calming influence. He gave his life	3.0904601133521075
for his beliefs.   The U&N& session scheduled for today	2.62331537708352
will meet under the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with	4.0508538674733225
the world on the edge of momentous developments.   If the manner	4.0077796115740645
of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication	4.617217436841913
the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason	3.542298966259603
and justice. That is the hope of mankind.	4.109108952575241

REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole community	4.424961290044846
has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks. Too	2.942841984929479
many have bogged down in bickering. Even when public bodies arrived at	2.5865237190126487
a consensus, at least one dissenting vote has been usual.   So	2.920120106161172
we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity. All nine members of	2.3246851867512603
the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody + Company's	2.1195735800303392
proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.	2.7203269340765788

The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms	3.680391335875017
of its contract. If the indenture is accepted, the authority will	3.2150493280571895
proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody	2.1412129245878897
will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious	5.014809769332615
Graves Tract to house the center.   The next step awaits	4.859972924454034
approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade	3.068439272139148
County Port Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to	3.2564824366359404
support Interama until its own financing could be arranged. Less than	2.7140080644473015
half the sum has been spent, since the Interama board pinched pennies	3.034190854268835
during that period of painstaking negotiations. The balance is being	3.097659994022939
budgeted for the coming year.   Unanimity on Interama is not	3.1119082043747928
surprising. It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly	4.000668878550285
everyone is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim	3.4988537264072828
of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project.	5.090267007979529
County officials have cooperated consistently. So have the people's	2.496498998509713
elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.   Interama,	4.014929760113647
as it rises, will be a living monument to Greater Miami's	3.5630349198773135

lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all, requiring only four	2.978830516856307
paragraphs.   "The established pattern of relative calm in the	2.4089489701550684

#WEST GERMANY REMAINS WESTERN#	1.2885451003909798
	1.0
WEST GERMANY will	1.0
face the crucial tests that lie ahead, on Berlin and unification, with	2.6838427980259456
a coalition government. This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's	3.7073573979060974
national election.   Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic	1.2591700714458969
Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough	4.9236420054849885
to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957. In	3.355273739864969
order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival	5.388338448843264
parties which gained strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.	2.502688229635284
	1.0
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired. Both	3.0522275535370538
Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22 seats in the	2.2295283164418858
new parliament, and the Free Democrats, who picked up 23, will insist	4.1954033584585115
on that before they enter the government.   Moon-faced Ludwig	3.084568505479084
Erhart, the economic expert, probably will ascend to the leadership	2.8299691965181033
long denied him.   If he becomes chancellor, Dr& Erhart would	2.7659430487785266
make few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing	2.207409861154539
industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise. He is dedicated	3.941041626105743
to building the nation's strength and, as are all West Germans,	3.9267261660434647
to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany.	2.817441435846369
	1.0
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the	4.444252531796333
voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.	3.4963881281894027
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per cent of the vote,	3.2432272021322746
approaches the party of Willy Brandt, which won 36 per cent, the result	3.444223038650821
would be a stiffening of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor	3.302860879491851
Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his	2.4621884634208997
city and won votes by it.   The Free Democrats (12 per cent	3.1475971754135053
of the vote) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with	3.7550802679996855
the Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist bloc.	3.396795345312716
	1.0
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly	3.078089534011029
toward more firmness or more flexibility. It could go either	3.101536965178379
way, since the gains for both points of view were about the same.	3.865111705558389
	1.0
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear. West Germany, with	3.3147920846146386
its industrial and military might, reaffirmed its democracy and remains	2.601021519297015
firm with the free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer,	3.7379618273664006
who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which	1.8277840108374728

#BETTER ASK BEFORE JOINING#	1.4509497411189725

AMERICANS	1.0
are a nation of joiners, a quality which our friends find endearing	3.248093365076005
and sometimes amusing. But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't	3.6712347617200285
want to make a spectacle of himself.   For instance, so-called	4.448946792039869
"conservative" organizations, some of them secret, are sprouting	3.093950092687389
in the garden of joining where "liberal" organizations once took	2.580541419205733
root.   One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which	2.6061781964924218
will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle is commendable	2.7816483544542985
but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get	3.966197162569425
gulled.   According to The Chicago Tribune News Service,	3.2319382263178107
State Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series	2.7046915939387497
of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization	3.0508976287292437
seeking his money and his name: _1._ Does it assail schools	3.594332217380469
and churches with blanket accusations? _2._ Does it attack other	2.6119878140533097
traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?	2.0555440567955277
	1.0
_3._ Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on	3.1449100370911696
everyone with whom it disagrees politically? _4._ Does it attempt	3.1670538687720287
to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars,	2.1728202668340293
communism, depression, and other troubles of the world? _5._ Does	3.793941075678056
it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone	2.6167061847612105
calls and letter writing campaigns? _6._ Do its spokesmen	2.532821618746828
seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the	3.80601079328805
principles they purport to advocate?   In some instances a seventh	3.401035208678335
question can be added: _7._ Does the organization show an	3.851464094832517
affinity for a foreign government, political party or personality in opposition	2.982980961831212
or preference to the American system?   If the would-be	3.9128936321479095
joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists	3.855611466936359
who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic	3.2962938378905644
apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere	2.8969409516488795
in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult	2.1781698519906394
to see but undeniably there, nevertheless- is the tropical green	3.0109553713578325
"city" of Islandia, a string of offshore islands that has almost	2.6500892695922267
no residents, limited access and an unlimited future. The latter is	2.7543342287850296
what concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from the North	4.248826227862192
tip end of Elliott Key looking southward, belongs to someone- people	2.8247963393419537
who have title to the land. And what you can't see, the land	5.5215426166776576
underneath the water, belongs to someone, too. The public. The only	3.7989642213744124
real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water	4.535026908004207
land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater	2.831671860769417
land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.	4.50618084991398
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the developers	2.6527228090661876
of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.	3.546391015975306
In this instance, happily, insistence is being made that our share	3.4748574203571607
is protected. And until this protection is at least as concrete as,	3.6643310158168343
say, the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach,	3.012524828810795

these noble words, however, has taken the efforts of five sessions of	3.727007191557334

The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession	4.399504576175106
from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union	3.462913215158389

the high estate of United States agriculture is the "strongest	2.9504017211847495
deterrent" to the spread of communism. But the secretary insists that	4.346444941748852
the success of the American farmer is the "greatest single source	4.093428570299559
of strength" in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.	3.6348703327970604

Mr& Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on	5.334466564037434
a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity	2.6169344468844438
to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or	2.475504908602941
even by the Soviet's successes in space. This shouldn't surprise	3.159799795130512
the secretary; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses	2.8615319220724005
for a long, long time.   In fact, over the years, the American	5.471911716914652
farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large	2.7951906567182054
dollar. And thus far, Mr& Freeman has offered very little relief.	2.8992996599002145

#WHAT'S WRONG AT STATE#	1.9500536692073112
@ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen& Jackson of Washington	2.4121319391478746
has been going over the State Department and has reached some	4.905696626192555
predictable conclusions. The department needs a clearer "sense of	3.1710406000834728
direction" at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, Sen&	4.6056785765349115
Jackson says.   The subcommittee is not alone in questioning	3.7348844739269396
the effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy has indicated	4.780221210045405
his dissatisfaction with its performance.   But those who would	3.579000803774316
revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the	3.033900963168081
resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures,	2.3655729099977747
suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.   Nor does Sen&	2.5115187736245965

the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the	3.592388879628302
study of foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion	3.1027243861171216
and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and	3.989121947271831
initiative among his subordinates.   But competent observers believe	2.0359005156971755
he is making progress, particularly toward what Sen& Jackson	2.276062522068326
lists as the primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our	4.0721967960954375

in the shape of a fedora.   His successor, Secretary Goldberg,	2.8169147313023766
also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which	3.8015570421939198
has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months. No	4.9182560457423845
betting man, Mr& Goldberg says he's merely "putting my neck out	2.30923527839601
again" by predicting the rate will go down this month. He is basing	4.679766650216156
his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened	3.0971495470611003
its stride- a new record high in personal income, an increase	2.965781579885179
in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for	3.306504298388485
durable goods.   Mr& Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the	2.855400970175142
steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr& Goldberg	3.024110312816514
has less reason for missing. The economy seems to be sailing along on	3.6012027259697765
an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an	3.2993450354808314
